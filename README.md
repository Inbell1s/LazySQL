# LazySQL

## **Fast sqlmap scanning and dumping.**

LazySQL script is used for fast sqlmap scanning and dumping.
If no URL is specified, LazySQL uses the last clipboard entry.
If the number of threads is not specified, LazySQL uses 3 as standard value.

Made for private use by Inbell1s.

## Usage

Use the command **lsql** to start the wizard.
Use the command **rsql** to resume injection.

U can find all injected urls with timestamp in "/.lsql.vul"

Use "**lsql --fast**" or "**fsql**" to quickstart using default settings and url on clipboard.
